# Is-It-Thursday?

A helpful website that tells the user if it is Thursday or not

# Description:

This web application uses moment.js to check the current day in the user's timezone and compares that value with the value of the best day of the week, Thursday. If it is indeed Thursday, the user will be presented with a message informing them that it is Thursday. If it is not Thursday, the user will be informed of this with a kind message to let them down easily.
